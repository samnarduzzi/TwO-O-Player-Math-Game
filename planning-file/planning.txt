Task 1: Extract Nouns for Classes
Player
Game
Question

Task 2: Write their roles
Player:
The Player class will represent the players in the game. Each player will have a name, score and lives. It will also have methods to update the player's score and lives.

Game:
The Game class will represent the game logic. It will have methods to generate a new question, check the player's answer, update the player's score and lives, and determine the winner.

Question:
The Question class will generate and hold information for a single math addition question, including the numbers that make up the question and the correct answer.

Task 3: Write down the methods for each class
Player:
- initialize(name): creates a new player instance with a given name, score and lives
- add_point: updates the player's score, by adding a point if they got the answer correct (score starts at 0)
- lose_life: updates the player's lives, by taking one away if they got the answer incorrect (lives start at 3)

Game:
- initialize(player1, player2): creates a new game instance with two player instances
- current_player: determines who the current player is
- start_game: runs the game loop where each instance of the loop is the other player's turn
- game_over?: checks if the game is over or not
- display_score: displays the current score of each player
- new_trun: generates and shows a new Question instance for the current player, checks if the answer is correct, and updates the current player's score or lives
- winner: determines who the winner is

Question:
- initialize(num1, num2): generates two random numbers between 1 and 20, and setting them as instance variables.
- question: generates a string of the question (ex. "What is 8 + 2?").
- answer: adds both numbers together
- answer_correct?: checks if the answer provided by the user is correct or not

- Which class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)?

The Game class will contain the game loop where each instance of the loop is the other player's turn.

- Which class should manage who the current_player is?

The Game class should manage who the current_player is.
